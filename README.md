# RN-AudioPlayer

Objective: To make a 1 Screen React Native app that:
- Lists out the 3 episodes in `episodes.json`.
- Has a Play button next to each episode that allows you to play the episode.
- Has a section on the bottom of the screen which allows you to:
  - Play
  - Pause
  - Go to the next track
  - Go to the previous track

Notes:
- Use https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player to help you play the audio tracks.
- This assignment will be mainly graded on code quality, so only basic UI / UX work required.
- Time esimation: up to 8 hours

Questions to answer once you're done:
- If you have more time to do UI / UX improvements, what improvements would you make?
- Do you see any pros / cons working with `react-native-track-player`?
- How would you go about implementing offline listening for the episodes?

When you want to submit the assigment & answers, email it to danny@taddy.org. You can either send in your code in a zip file or a link to the repo.
