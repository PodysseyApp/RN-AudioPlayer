# RN-AudioPlayer

Objective: To make a 1 Screen React Native app that:
- Lists out the 3 episodes in `episodes.json`.
- Has a Play button next to each episode that allows you to play the episode.
- Has a section on the bottom of the screen which allows you to:
  - Play
  - Pause
  - Go to the next track
  - Go to the previous track

Notes:
- Use https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player to help you play the audio tracks.
- Don't feel pressure to do much UI / UX work, this assignment will be mainly graded on code quality.
- Time esimation: up to 8 hours (if never worked on React Native or with `react-native-track-player`)

Questions to answer once you're done:
- If you have more time to do UI / UX improvements, what improvements would you make?
- Do you see any pros / cons working with `react-native-track-player`?
- How would you go about implementing offline listening for the episodes?
